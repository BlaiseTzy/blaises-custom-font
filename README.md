# blaise's custom font
a github repository for my handwritten custom font.

this font features **my own handwriting**, which is very neat, and clean. i originally planned to use this for myself, but i decided to make it **accessible to the public** for free, to preserve my handwriting, in case i ever pass away.

# creation
this font was created purely through my own handwriting. as of today, it currently supports all **uppercase and lowercase** characters, **normal, subscript and superscript numbers**, and a bit more.
